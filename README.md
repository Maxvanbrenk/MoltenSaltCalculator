# Molten Salt Properties Python Evaluator

This repository contains the final code developed for my bachelor thesis, *A Molten Salt Properties Python Evaluator*. The code is provided as a Jupyter notebook. As discussed in the thesis, the current version of the code is not yet accurate enough for direct use in research. Further development and improvements are ongoing in the following repository: https://github.com/leiapple/MoltenSaltCalc.git
